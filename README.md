- Stack Implementation :Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
Elements are pushed/popped from the "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the stack.
- Maps : Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order. In Map, key values are generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, while the mapped values store the content associated to this key. The mapped values in a map can be accessed directly by their corresponding key using the bracket operator ((operator[]).
